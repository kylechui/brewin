# `brewin` Interpreter

This is my solution for the second interpreter project for CS 131 Spring 2023:
`brewin`. Here are a few sources/references:

- [Starter code](https://github.com/UCLA-CS-131/spring-23-project-starter)
- [Autograder](https://github.com/UCLA-CS-131/spring-23-autograder)
- Solution score: 88/89
  - Failing cases: `inher8`

To run the autograder, make sure you are in the project root and run `python3
tester.py 2`.
