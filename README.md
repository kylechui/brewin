# `brewin` Interpreter

This is my solution for the first interpreter project for CS 131 Spring 2023:
`brewin`. Here are a few sources/references:

- [Language specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pPQ2qZKbbsbZGBSwvuy1Ir-NZLPMgVt95WPQuI5aPho/edit#)
- [Starter code](https://github.com/UCLA-CS-131/spring-23-project-starter)
- [Autograder](https://github.com/UCLA-CS-131/spring-23-autograder)
- Solution score: 50/50

To run the autograder, make sure you are in the project root and run `python3
tester.py 1`.
